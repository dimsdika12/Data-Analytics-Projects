# Background Project: Telco - Data Preprocessing

Telco is a telecommunications company with numerous branches nationwide. Since its establishment in 2019, Telco has consistently focused on enhancing its customer experience to retain its customer base.

Despite being relatively young, having just over a year in the industry, Telco has experienced a significant number of customers switching their subscriptions to competitors. The management aims to reduce customer churn by implementing machine learning techniques.

In this project, the focus is on Data Preprocessing (Data Cleansing) for the previous month, June 2020. The objective is to prepare the data by:

- Validating Customer IDs (Phone Numbers)
- Handling Missing Values
- Managing Outliers in Each Variable
- Standardizing Variable Values
  
This Data Preprocessing process is crucial in ensuring data quality and readiness for subsequent analysis or modeling tasks.
