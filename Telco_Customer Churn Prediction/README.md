# Telco_Customer Churn Prediction
Telco is a telecommunications company operating across multiple branches nationwide. Established in 2019, 
Telco has prioritized enhancing customer experience to maintain its customer base.

Despite being relatively new to the industry, having operated for just over a year, 
Telco has encountered a notable number of customers switching their subscriptions to competitors. 
To mitigate this churn rate, the management has initiated the implementation of machine learning techniques.

**Project Background**
--
This project is a continuation of the "Telco - Data Preprocessing" phase, accessible at [Link to Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/dimsdika12/DataAnalystProject_Python/tree/main/Telco_Data%20Preprocessing)
.

In the previous phase, data cleansing was performed. In this phase, the objective is to create an accurate predictive model.

Project Flow

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the data and identify patterns.
- **Data Pre-Processing:** Prepare data for modeling purposes.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Utilize the data from the previous step to create predictive models.
- **Identify the Best Model:** Evaluate models to determine the most accurate one for churn prediction.
