# **Background**

Bike sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals, where the entire process from membership, rental, and return has become automated. With these systems, users can conveniently rent a bike from one location and return it to another. Currently, there are more than 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, consisting of over 500,000 bicycles. These systems have garnered significant interest due to their impact on traffic, environmental concerns, and public health.

Beyond their real-world applications, the data generated by bike sharing systems is intriguing for research. Unlike other transportation services like buses or subways, these systems record explicit information, such as travel duration, departure and arrival locations. This unique feature transforms bike sharing systems into virtual sensor networks that can monitor mobility within a city. Consequently, these data can be leveraged to detect significant events and trends in the city.

# **Data Set**

The bike-sharing rental process is closely related to environmental and seasonal factors. Weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day, among other variables, can significantly influence rental patterns. The core dataset used in this analysis pertains to a two-year historical log from 2011 and 2012, collected from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA. This dataset is publicly available at [http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data](http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).

To enhance the dataset, we aggregated the data on both two-hourly and daily bases. We also incorporated additional information related to weather and seasons. Weather data was obtained from [http://www.freemeteo.com](http://www.freemeteo.com), providing a comprehensive view of the factors affecting bike-sharing rental behavior.
